After getting this site getting thrown together yesterday I was excited to show
my girlfriend. I closed up my comptuer and headed out to the living room to 
show her but was suprised when I was met with a "502: Bad Gateway". I was a bit
suprised since not even two minutes ago, I was able to verify that the site was 
working end to end. My suspicision was that I was screwing up setting up a long
running process on a linux box. The command I was using to get a long running
process going was `./playgroundsite </dev/null &>/dev/null &`.

The next morning I did some poking around and realized that upon closing the
terminal a HUP (Hang up) signal was being sent to the running background process
that was killing it. I realized the errors of my ways and found out about the linux
`nohup` command. When a command was run via nohup, it would become immune to the 
effects of the NOHUP signal. I updated the command to run the process to the 
following: `nohup ./playgroundsite </dev/null &>/dev/null &` and now it works as 
expected :)

I return to my girlfriend with a more reliable website and ask her to try again!
She turns her phone to me and shows that the website is hanging and nothing is being
displayed. She had typed into her phone's browser 'akbar.link'. Grrr. 

After doing some poking with curl on my machine, I realized that typing in
'akbar.link' without HTTPS was sending a HTTP request for the site but my load 
balancer was only configured to pick up HTTPS traffic and forward itto my backend 
host. A quick update of the load balancer listener rules to redirect HTTP to HTTPS 
and a quick check with curl (with the help of the -L flag to follow redirects) I 
was able to verify that it worked and using just `akbar.link` would return the content 
of my site!

While writing out this post I realized that there is two additional things that would
be nice for me to build out, one would be a linter tool for these posts. When I need
to cut some words out, it's a pain doing the restrucuting of the lines myself to get
80 characters per line. Another thing is to have my remote machine pickup changes in
github automatically instead of me having to ssh and setup up the new version of the 
code myself, a cron job would do great here.
